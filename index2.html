			<p id="editor-text">Type in the words "Is USC…" on Google, and it doesn’t take long to see it on the dropdown search options. After the usual prospective college student questions like "Is USC hard to get into?" and "Is USC a party school?", it’s right there — "Is USC safe?" The question is broached during many in college tours by curious prospective students and worried parents alike. It is fair to ask, given the campus’ location near downtown Los Angeles, miles away from Skid Row. Senseless crimes and murders in recent years around the USC area have shaken its perception.
			<br><br>In this "Crime and Safety" supplement, we will explore the questions surrounding safety at USC. We find trends after tracking a year in crime. We look at how the Department of Public Safety operates and how it embeds itself with the community it protects. We interact with the "yellow jackets" who guard the gates at night and campus cruiser drivers who get us home in one piece. And we examine whether gentrification has affected crime in the area.
			<br><br>The challenges of dealing with crime come with living in a metropolis, a topic that is worth a deep dive. So, read on for a look into the people responsible for keeping our campus and community safe.</p>
